This document contains the player and enemy stats, and describes in mechanical terms how random calculations in the game are done.

Attacking:
The attacker rolls an n-sided die, and adds their damage modifier to calculate damage.

Fleeing:
The player rolls a six-sided die, and add their evasion modifier. If this modifier is greater than the enemy's perception, the escape is successful.

Avoidance:
When changing rooms, the player rolls a six-sided die and adds their evasion modifier. If this modifier is less than or equal to 2, they encounter a monster. This does not apply to safe locations and the boss lair.
