# Los Torreros

Los Torreros is a very simple RPG-like game. You walk around fighting monsters until you find the boss.

# Dependencies

You only need Python 3. With some modification, this could likely run on Python 2.

rlwrap is used if the program is available, if not then the game will still run fine.

# Installation

Just type the following:

    # ./install.sh

Then invoke the game with

    # los-torreros

If you just want to test the game, enter this directory and type

    $ python3 los-torreros.py
